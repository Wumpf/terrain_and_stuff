# Random ideas

The more unconventional the better!

## Art style / overall direction

- Floating islands in the sky
  - or in.. space?! 
  - Advantages:
    - overall direction is that it's phantastical, thus detaches from the usual pitfall of making everything super realistic
    - much more forgiving for all inevitable quirks & mistakes.
    - challenge of scaling in numbers versus scaling in detail & size
  - If I have a strong itch for water simulation again: Regular islands in an endless ocean

## Terrain generation

- Combine several independent blobs to clumps of land
- top & bottom could be generaeted differently, or smoothing/roughing is differently done depending on direction
