Terrain & Stuff
========================================================
A graphics demo where I play around with - you guessed - it terrain and stuff!

* Spiritual successor to https://github.com/Wumpf/terrainwatersim
* Framework based on https://github.com/Wumpf/minifb_wgpu_web_and_desktop

TODO: more readme :)


Tech Stack
-----------------

* [wgpu](https://github.com/gfx-rs/wgpu) for rendering
* [naga_oil](https://github.com/bevyengine/naga_oil) for shader (pre-)processing
* [minifb](https://github.com/emoon/minifb) for windowing and event handling
* [egui](https://github.com/emilk/egui) for UI
  * using a custom, minimalistic binding to minifb instead of [eframe](https://github.com/emilk/egui/tree/master/crates/eframe)


Sky rendering
-----------------

Based on [Sébastien Hillaire's "A Scalable and Production Ready
Sky and Atmosphere Rendering Technique"](https://sebh.github.io/publications/egsr2020.pdf) (Eurographics Symposium on Rendering 2020).
See also Sébastien's [talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SW30QX1wxTY) about the topic at SIGGRAPH's 2020 Physically Based Shading Course.

Various implementations exists:
* [official demo implementation](https://github.com/sebh/UnrealEngineSkyAtmosphere) by Sébastien himself.
* [Andrew Helmer's ShaderToy](https://www.shadertoy.com/view/slSXRW).
* [Lukas Herzbeger's rigorous WebGPU implementation](https://github.com/JolifantoBambla/webgpu-sky-atmosphere) with many different configuration options and compute shader variants

TODO: haven't implemented the whole thing yet - missing are multiple scattering and shadow map sampling.

Display transform
-----------------

All calculations are done in Bt.709 linear luminance values (i.e. using photometric units if not specified otherwise).

As explained in https://seblagarde.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/course_notes_moving_frostbite_to_pbr_v32.pdf
it has some advantages to keep all units radiometric for non-spectral rendering and a fixed conversion factor can be assumed.

The HDR Bt.709 stimulus is then mapped to LDR using [Tony McMapface](https://github.com/h3r2tic/tony-mc-mapface)
and converted to sRGB "gamma" space by applying the sRGB OETF.

TODO: Would be interesting to explore supporting Display P3 output as well!
Unfortunately, that would mean we need a different display transform then since there's no HDR output for Tony.


Lighting
-----------------

Indirect sky light
==================
TODO: Not done any of this yet, this is just the plan!

Compute a 3 band (order 2) spherical harmonic of the sky's luminance, ignoring the sun.
Sun is obviously _a lot_ brighter than everything else,
so not only would it ruin the SH coefficients for everything else but we can also do more interesting
BRDFs by treating it as a simple directional light.

Then, for the actual indirect lighting, compute illuminance by integrating cosine lobe
TODO: Why stop at lambert/illuminance here? Might as well sample luminance in a direction to approximate some specularity as well!

This is done by a compute shader sampling the sky's luminance at a fixed height using same method we use per screen pixel when raymarching the atmosphere.
Steps:
* each invocation computes one sample on the sphere and keeps this sample in register
* for SH coefficient:
  * compute the sample's coefficient value
  * write it to shared memory
  * perform a reduction over the shared memory to get the average coefficient value
  * write final coefficient value to the output buffer
TODO: can we do enough samples in a single pass like this or should we repeat this process?
