Sky rendering
-----------------

Based on [Sébastien Hillaire's "A Scalable and Production Ready
Sky and Atmosphere Rendering Technique"](https://sebh.github.io/publications/egsr2020.pdf) (Eurographics Symposium on Rendering 2020),
and [Andrew Helmer's ShaderToy](https://www.shadertoy.com/view/tdSXzD) ShaderToy implementation of the former.

See also Sébastien's [talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SW30QX1wxTY) about the topic at SIGGRAPH's 2020 Physically Based Shading Course.
